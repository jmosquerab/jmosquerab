## Hello, I'm Joaquín
I'm a Statistics MSc student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). Previously, I did my BSc in mathematics at [Universidad de los Andes](https://www.uniandes.edu.co) in Bogotá, Colombia, where I'm originally from. I wish to explore applications of probability and statistics in fields like

- finance,
- data science, and
- machine learning.

Outside of mathematics and statistics, I enjoy watching and playing both football and basketball, and I've recently started baking and learning new languages.
